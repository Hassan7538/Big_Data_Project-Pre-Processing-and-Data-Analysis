<h>Text Processing and Machine Learning Algorithms for Recipe Analysis</h>
<br>
This repository contains a collection of tools and implementations for text preprocessing and machine learning algorithms applied to recipe datasets. It includes functionalities for text tokenization, Hashing TF-IDF vectorization, and various machine learning models trained on one dataset named Sentiment.csv.

In addition to machine learning components, this repository also features implementations for calculating cosine and centered cosine similarity metrics between recipes and their respective ingredients. These similarity metrics are computed using another dataset named recipes_combined.csv, facilitating recipe recommendation and ingredient analysis.
<h3>Key Features:</h3>
